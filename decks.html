					<h2 class = "content-subhead" id = "setup">Building a deck in Gwent</h2>
					<p>
						Gwent was initially a deck building game. Now, the main difficulty to make Gwent interesting and playable with 2 human players is... building decks. No kidding.
					</p>
					<p>
						In The Witcher 3, the purpose was to build the strongest and most imbalance deck. Of course, players wanted to win and the computer does not complain about always losing.
						<br />
						As a consequence, there was obvious choices of decks to have the highest chances of victory, using Nilfgaard or the Northern Realms as faction, with a lot of spies, medics and decoys.
						<br />
						Such decks are boring to play, especially as multiplier, so we want to get out of this dead end and make something more interesting out of the existing game.
					</p>
					<p>
						Firstly, we want to accept one thing, to have more enjoyable games, decks must be weaker. They must contain less broken cards to leave more room for actual strategy.
						<br />
						Goal is no longer to win 100% of games but instead to enjoy all games.
					</p>
					<p>
						There hasn't yet been any consensus about the best method to constitute a balanced and enjoyable deck. Various discussions can be found on the internet but most of them suggest the draw method, with variations.
						<br />
						Basically, the idea is like this:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Pick a Faction (randomly if you prefer)
							</li>
							<li>
								Pick a Leader (randomly if you prefer)
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Now constitue your deck as follows (or with your own variation):</b>
							</li>
							<li>
								Shuffle your deck
							</li>
							<li>
								Draw 3 cards. Keep 1 and discard the 2 others (variation, you can keep two, but only a limited amount of times)
							</li>
							<li>
								Do this until you have at least 22 unit cards and max 10 special cards.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						For more balance, it is recommanded to add more restrictions, such as:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Max 5 heroes per deck.
							</li>
							<li>
								Max 2 spies per deck.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h2 class = "content-subhead" id = "setup">Our approach</h2>
					<p>
						The above approach has the advantage to add more variety, because there is some uncertainty in the building of the deck.
						<br />
						It is less likely to face several times the same deck.
						<br />
						We however see several big drawbacks which we don't like:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Building your deck over and over is slow. Unless you have fun building a new deck again incrementaly, this is a waste of time.
							</li>
							<li>
								You are less likely to build an efficient deck with a specific playstyle.
							</li>
							<li>
								The outcome will be a rather random mix of cards with a limited connection to the Witcher Universe.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Consequently, we have built a set of decks with the following method and state of mind:</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								A deck must be coherent to a part of the Witcher universe.
							</li>
							<li>
								A deck must have a playstyle that is unique if possible, but at least different from most decks.
							</li>
							<li>
								Preferably a deck must have 5 heroes, + or - 1.
							</li>
							<li>
								Preferably a deck must have between 22 and 30 unit cards (heroes included).
							</li>
							<li>
								Preferably a deck must have between 5 and 10 special cards, usually around 7.
							</li>
							<li>
								The weight of a deck should be balanced as compared to the weight of the other decks (often between 270 and 300 in our method).
							</li>
							<li>
								A character should preferably be available in only one deck.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h2 class = "content-subhead" id = "setup">Wait, did you say weight?</h2>
					<p>
						Well yes, our main method for balancing decks is actually similar to the modern Gwent game.
						<br />
						We try to compute a weight for each card (except special cards), which is comparable to the "Provision" value the modern Gwent game is using.
					</p>
					<p>
						Don't be too scared! Just like the classic Gwent 3.1 is simpler with less abilities, it does not need to fine tune the weight of each card accurately.
						<br />
						Basically, the idea is to statistically estimate the strength potential of a card, based on its abilities. This isn't easy to do it for each ability, but we tried to have a good estimation.
						<br />
						Here are the big lines:
						<ul>
							<li>
								A basic unit card with a strength of 7 has a weight of 7. Simple, we play it, it adds 7 points to the total score. Of course this can be altered, in good or bad, but this is not the point.
							</li>
							<li>
								On the other hand, a hero of strength 10 will also add 10 points, but it cannot be altered. We took the decision to apply a multiplier of 2, so the weight of this hero would be 20. This is the trickiest part to weight, the fact it can or cannot be affected by abilities. However, since most hero cards have the same strength (around 10), and if each deck has almost the same amount of heroes, this multiplier does not really have a significance in the balance/total weight.
							</li>
							<li>
								Before talking about the other abilities weight, we need to jump to the end to justify some choices.
								We have seen that overall, the average weight of a card is around 10, heroes included. It goes down to around 8 without heroes. So this gives us an idea of the average value/potential of a card.
							</li>
							<li>
								Let's start with the infamous spy ability. It gives 2 cards but gives some strength to the enemy, so the weight is
								<code>(2*10) - spy_strength</code>
								(10 being the average weight of a card).
							</li>
							<li>
								Similarly, a medic brings back a unit card (not a hero) of average weight 8. However some of these units won't be able to use their ability (such as Muster), so we considerd the weight to be
								<code>7 + medic_strength</code>.
							</li>
							<li>
								Muster and Tight Bond: these are a little tricky because they work in groups. You have several copies of the same card, but their potential changes a lot when used correcly.
								<br />
								Actual potential also changes depending on the number of copies available.
								<br />
								In short, we have chosen to apply a multiplier of 2 for both. It simplifies their behaviour, but a probability analysis of these abilities has shown that, compared to a basic card being played, the effect of these abilities multiples the outcome potential by around 2.
							</li>
							<li>
								We will not go into details for each of the other abilities because they are even more guesses (very situational). Most of the other abilities have an added weight of 5 (added to the unit strength), such as for Scorch, Morale Boost or Summon Avenger.
								<br />
								The main exception to this is Commander's Horn which has an added weight of 10. We have also decided to give an added weigth of 2 to agile cards, which have the option to be played in 2 rows;
							</li>
							<li>
								For now, all leaders have a weight of 20 by default. We haven't yet gone into the trouble of fine tuning their weight.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						Let's be realistic, this is not exact science, this is not perfect.
						<br />
						But try it yourself and you'll see that it is already enough to show when a deck is far stronger (put a lot of Tight Bond cards in a deck) or very weak.
						<br />
						We believe it does its job well enough to end up with decks of comparable potential. Tests have shown good results.
					</p>
					<p>
						With all this in mind, we came up with a selection of decks which we think remain true to the Witcher Universe all while being interesting to play.
